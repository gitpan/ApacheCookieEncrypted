Revision history for Perl extension Apache::Cookie::Encrypted.

0.03  Mon June 4 15:00:00 2001
	- changed the key retrieval system. This makes this module for use with
	  mod_perl only. I guess I'll have to work on one for plain CGI using 
	  CGI::Cookie just to be fair. :)

0.02  Sat June 2 23:30:00 2001
	- fixed inheritance. It just wasn't working for some reason.

0.01  Thu May 31 23:00:22 2001
	- original version;
